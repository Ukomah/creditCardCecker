Codecademy - Credit card checker
The project has 3 functions, viz:

a) validateCred(): The purpose of validateCred() is to return true when an array contains
digits of a valid credit card number and false when it is invalid. The values of the
original array are not mutated.
To find out if a credit card number is valid or not, we used the Luhn algorithm.
The Luhn algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)
is a series of mathematical calculations used 
to validate certain identification numbers, e.g. credit card numbers

b) findInvalidCards() : to check through the nested arrays 
for which numbers are invalid, and return another nested array of invalid cards. 

c) idInvalidCardCompanies() : has one parameter for a nested array of invalid numbers
and returns an array of companies based on the value of the first digit in an array.
